**Client Stories Testing**

The most common path users take through the website is:

Home > Ensembles and Projects > Contact

Each of these pages has a natural progression to the next. Should the user get to the bottom of the page and decide they wish to make contact with the musician each page features an easily identifiable button which links directly to the contact page so they do not have to scroll back to the top.

To reduce information overload on the Home page, the information about the musician has been reduced to an exciting headline.  The user is able to learn more by downloading a full Biography using the easy to idetify Download button which opens in a seperate tab.

The Ensembles and Projects page features links to the external websites of each group or project which open in a seperate tab.  The text chosen for each group is designed to display the standard and flexibility of range that the musician has without detracting from them as a soloist.  The text and external links aim to entice the user to read more.
